Shoko's Moon Generator

What's this plugin about?
-It's a world generator plugin, as it names suggest it helps you generate a world based on the Moon, It's the most "moon-like" plugin out there! but it's not just a generator it comes with a lot of new functionality for your server that your users will definetly love! <3

How to install?
1.Make sure you're using the lastest version of Spigot / Paper / Sponge
2.Install a World Management Plugin to your server (Recommended: Multiverse-core)
2.Download this plugin and put it into your plugins folder
3.Now restart you're server and it's done ! :D

How to update?
1. Make sure to Turn Off the server, and download the lastest version of the plugin.
2. Delete the MoonGenerator folder (aka the config folder) in the plugins folder(otherwise it will cause troubles).
3.Replace the old Moongenerator.jar for the new one
4. Start the server and you're ready to go! :D

How to use?
1.First you need to create a world for the moon, if you're using Multiverse you can use this command:
/mv create Moon normal -g MoonGenerator
This will create the world "Moon" using the MoonGenerator plugin
(It's important that your world is called "Moon" (not "moon" nor "mOoN") )
2.You can go to your world using this command:
/mvtp Moon
and if it says a message like (blabla confirm that you want to blablabla)
you just do /mvconfirm
3.Now you'll notice that if you're in SURVIVAL or ADVENTURE mode you'll recieve 3 effects, damage, slow falling, jump boost (these are to simulate moon gravity) so the damage is because you can't breathe in that atmosphere, so you must use a Proper Helmet, just pick up any glass block (glass or stained glass) and drag and drop it in your helmet slot, and you'll see it's just like magic! so this will prevent you from getting damage from the air!
4. More things will be added soon if you have any suggestions don't forget to tell me

What if I don't want players to use Glass as helmets or Gravity effects or ... etc
-Well you can go to your config file and disable all the things that you don't want/like you can even add more than one world! :)

FEATURES:
-You can create a world using the MoonGenerator to make it look like the moon :eek:
-You can drag and drop a glass block you your helmet slot to equip it in SURVIVAL MODE(user friendly, no commands)
-When you're in the moon you get slowfalling and jumpboost to simulate gravity
